currently, only object detection api is live so you can build and use that view.  deconv model will go live soon. once models are up, ill be making those repos public 

haven't added the flask api because I'm still refactoring the underlying keras model , so capture button won't do anything yet
but the post request is there if you want to point it to your api (which should generate an image and send back its url )  

To use: 
`yarn install`
`yarn start`


better documentation , live view, more feature visualizations to come as I finish up the app, putting out template and keeping repo public in case anyone wants to check out the wip so far
